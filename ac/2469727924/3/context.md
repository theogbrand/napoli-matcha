## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

Read through @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md carefully top to bottom to read back the clarity of the plan is aligned with the feature enhancements I had in mind, especially since I have edited the plan indepedently multiple times

### Prompt 2

Solve all ambituities by asking me questions, and applying changes 1 by 1 after the issue is clarified.

### Prompt 3

Actually by using cloud sandboxes and the orchestrator to change the state of the tickets, does it still make sense for tickets to be local, or is it better to use Linear or an external database which can safely edit the states of the tickets that continuously change while all my agents are running in sandboxes and completing tasks at different speeds

### Prompt 4

How does merging currently happen? My intention was merges to be similar to Horizon Agent, where it can be auto, pr or merge.
