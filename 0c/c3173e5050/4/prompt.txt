I want to activate my /deslop skill after every TaskCompleted event, so the skill "deslops" code generated after every major Plan implementation, help me add this Claude Code Hook.

---

where is this TaskCompleted hook currently configured so I know where I can enable/disable it?

---

Can you instead move this hook to project-specific instead?
