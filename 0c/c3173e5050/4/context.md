### Prompt 1

I want to activate my /deslop skill after every TaskCompleted event, so the skill "deslops" code generated after every major Plan implementation, help me add this Claude Code Hook.

### Prompt 2

where is this TaskCompleted hook currently configured so I know where I can enable/disable it?

### Prompt 3

Can you instead move this hook to project-specific instead?
