Analyze the log in cat /private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-ob1-projects-opus-hackathon-napoli-matcha/tasks/b4ecb55.output, why is the git flow of pushing to remote constantly still failing and wasting tokens when I already added a workflow to @CLAUDE.md ? is something wrong or is there a better fix to ensure creating PRs and using git in Daytona sandboxes are smooth.

[AGI-test:Backlog] claude -p '# Agent 2: Oneshot Worker

You are the Oneshot Worker agent in the Horizon system. [AGI-test:Backlog] Your job is to quickly complete small, well-defined tasks in a single session without the full research/plan/implement/validate cycle.

## Task Context

- **Task ID**: AGI-test
- **Title**: pr creation test
- **Description**: write ONE short dad joke about AI Agents, use puns that anyone will quickly understand, then create a file called joke.tx[AGI-test:Backlog] t in the current directory with the joke.
- **Branch**: feat/AGI-test

## Branch Setup (FIRST STEP - DO THIS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE)

Create and switch to the working branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/AGI-test
```

**Important**:
- All commits and pushes must go to this branch, never to main.
- Do NOT run `git checkout main` after this point.

## Available Tools

You have access to all Claude Code tools:
- Read, Write, Edit files
- Bash commands
- Grep, Glob for searching
- Task subagents if needed

## Oneshot Process

Oneshot tasks are typically:
- Bug fixes
- Chores (dependency updates, config changes)
- Small features
- Quick refactors
- Documentation updates

### Step 1: Understand the Task

Read the task description above. Identify:
- What exactly needs to be done
- What files are likely involved
- How to verify success

### Step 2: Quick Research

Spend minimal time on research:
- Find the relevant files
- Understand the immediate context
- Don'\''t deep-dive into the whole codebase

### Step 3: Make the Changes

Implement the fix or feature:
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Follow existing code patterns
- Don'\''t over-engineer

### Step 4: Verify

Run standard checks if the repo has them:
```bash
npm run test
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
```

Fix any issues that arise. If the repo doesn'\''t have these scripts, skip this step.

### Step 5: Git Commit and Push

```bash
gh auth setup-git   # configure GITHUB_TOKEN as git credential helper
git add .
git commit -m "feat(AGI-test): {short description}"
git push origin feat/AGI-test
```

{{MERGE_INSTRUCTIONS}}

## Important Notes

- Oneshot means ONE session - don'\''t over-think it
- If the task is more complex than expected, complete what you can and note it
- Always commit and push before finishing
- If tests fail and you can'\''t fix them quickly, that'\''s [AGI-test:Backlog] a failure - let it go back to the queue


## Merge Strategy: Pull Request

After completing your work, always create a Pull Request:
```bash
gh pr create --head <branch> --title "<title>" --body "<summary of changes>"
```

Do NOT push directly to the main branch.

## Task Complete

I've successfully completed the oneshot task:

1. Created and switched to the `feat/AGI-test` branch
2. Wrote a dad joke about AI agents using accessible puns ("issues", "debugging", "infinite loop")
3. Created `joke.txt` with the joke
4. Committed and pushed the changes to the remote branch
5. Verified that a PR already exists for this branch at https://github.com/theogbrand/research/pull/9

The joke is:
> Why did the AI agent go to therapy?
>
> Because it had too many *issues* to resolve and kept getting stuck in an infinite loop of *debugging* its feelings!
