### Prompt 1

Analyze the log in cat /private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-ob1-projects-opus-hackathon-napoli-matcha/tasks/b4ecb55.output, why is the git flow of pushing to remote constantly still failing and wasting tokens when I already added a workflow to @CLAUDE.md ? is something wrong or is there a better fix to ensure creating PRs and using git in Daytona sandboxes are smooth.
