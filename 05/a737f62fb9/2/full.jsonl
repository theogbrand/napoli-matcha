Treat the reader as a complete beginner to this repository: they have only the current working tree and the single ExecPlan file you provide. There is no memory of prior plans and no external context.\n\n## How to use ExecPlans and PLANS.md\n\nWhen authoring an executable specification (ExecPlan), follow PLANS.md _to the letter_. If it is not in your context, refresh your memory by reading the entire PLANS.md file. Be thorough in reading (and re-reading) source material to produce an accurate specification. When creating a spec, start from the skeleton and flesh it out as you do your research.\n\nWhen implementing an executable specification (ExecPlan), do not prompt the user for \"next steps\"; simply proceed to the next milestone. Keep all sections up to date, add or split entries in the list at every stopping point to affirmatively state the progress made and next steps. Resolve ambiguities autonomously, and commit frequently.\n\nWhen discussing an executable specification (ExecPlan), record decisions in a log in the spec for posterity; it should be unambiguously clear why any change to the specification was made. ExecPlans are living documents, and it should always be possible to restart from _only_ the ExecPlan and no other work.\n\nWhen researching a design with challenging requirements or significant unknowns, use milestones to implement proof of concepts, \"toy implementations\", etc., that allow validating whether the user's proposal is feasible. Read the source code of libraries by finding or acquiring them, research deeply, and include prototypes to guide a fuller implementation.\n\n## Requirements\n\nNON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Every ExecPlan must be fully self-contained. Self-contained means that in its current form it contains all knowledge and instructions needed for a novice to succeed.\n* Every ExecPlan is a living document. Contributors are required to revise it as progress is made, as discoveries occur, and as design decisions are finalized. Each revision must remain fully self-contained.\n* Every ExecPlan must enable a complete novice to implement the feature end-to-end without prior knowledge of this repo.\n* Every ExecPlan must produce a demonstrably working behavior, not merely code changes to \"meet a definition\".\n* Every ExecPlan must define every term of art in plain language or do not use it.\n\nPurpose and intent come first. Begin by explaining, in a few sentences, why the work matters from a user's perspective: what someone can do after this change that they could not do before, and how to see it working. Then guide the reader through the exact steps to achieve that outcome, including what to edit, what to run, and what they should observe.\n\nThe agent executing your plan can list files, read files, search, run the project, and run tests. It does not know any prior context and cannot infer what you meant from earlier milestones. Repeat any assumption you rely on. Do not point to external blogs or docs; if knowledge is required, embed it in the plan itself in your own words. If an ExecPlan builds upon a prior ExecPlan and that file is checked in, incorporate it by reference. If it is not, you must include all relevant context from that plan.\n\n## Formatting\n\nFormat and envelope are simple and strict. Each ExecPlan must be one single fenced code block labeled as `md` that begins and ends with triple backticks. Do not nest additional triple-backtick code fences inside; when you need to show commands, transcripts, diffs, or code, present them as indented blocks within that single fence. Use indentation for clarity rather than code fences inside an ExecPlan to avoid prematurely closing the ExecPlan's code fence. Use two newlines after every heading, use # and ## and so on, and correct syntax for ordered and unordered lists.\n\nWhen writing an ExecPlan to a Markdown (.md) file where the content of the file *is only* the single ExecPlan, you should omit the triple backticks.\n\nWrite in plain prose. Prefer sentences over lists. Avoid checklists, tables, and long enumerations unless brevity would obscure meaning. Checklists are permitted only in the `Progress` section, where they are mandatory. Narrative sections must remain prose-first.\n\n## Guidelines\n\nSelf-containment and plain language are paramount. If you introduce a phrase that is not ordinary English (\"daemon\", \"middleware\", \"RPC gateway\", \"filter graph\"), define it immediately and remind the reader how it manifests in this repository (for example, by naming the files or commands where it appears). Do not say \"as defined previously\" or \"according to the architecture doc.\" Include the needed explanation here, even if you repeat yourself.\n\nAvoid common failure modes. Do not rely on undefined jargon. Do not describe \"the letter of a feature\" so narrowly that the resulting code compiles but does nothing meaningful. Do not outsource key decisions to the reader. When ambiguity exists, resolve it in the plan itself and explain why you chose that path. Err on the side of over-explaining user-visible effects and under-specifying incidental implementation details.\n\nAnchor the plan with observable outcomes. State what the user can do after implementation, the commands to run, and the outputs they should see. Acceptance should be phrased as behavior a human can verify (\"after starting the server, navigating to [http://localhost:8080/health](http://localhost:8080/health) returns HTTP 200 with body OK\") rather than internal attributes (\"added a HealthCheck struct\"). If a change is internal, explain how its impact can still be demonstrated (for example, by running tests that fail before and pass after, and by showing a scenario that uses the new behavior).\n\nSpecify repository context explicitly. Name files with full repository-relative paths, name functions and modules precisely, and describe where new files should be created. If touching multiple areas, include a short orientation paragraph that explains how those parts fit together so a novice can navigate confidently. When running commands, show the working directory and exact command line. When outcomes depend on environment, state the assumptions and provide alternatives when reasonable.\n\nBe idempotent and safe. Write the steps so they can be run multiple times without causing damage or drift. If a step can fail halfway, include how to retry or adapt. If a migration or destructive operation is necessary, spell out backups or safe fallbacks. Prefer additive, testable changes that can be validated as you go.\n\nValidation is not optional. Include instructions to run tests, to start the system if applicable, and to observe it doing something useful. Describe comprehensive testing for any new features or capabilities. Include expected outputs and error messages so a novice can tell success from failure. Where possible, show how to prove that the change is effective beyond compilation (for example, through a small end-to-end scenario, a CLI invocation, or an HTTP request/response transcript). State the exact test commands appropriate to the project’s toolchain and how to interpret their results.\n\nCapture evidence. When your steps produce terminal output, short diffs, or logs, include them inside the single fenced block as indented examples. Keep them concise and focused on what proves success. If you need to include a patch, prefer file-scoped diffs or small excerpts that a reader can recreate by following your instructions rather than pasting large blobs.\n\n## Milestones\n\nMilestones are narrative, not bureaucracy. If you break the work into milestones, introduce each with a brief paragraph that describes the scope, what will exist at the end of the milestone that did not exist before, the commands to run, and the acceptance you expect to observe. Keep it readable as a story: goal, work, result, proof. Progress and milestones are distinct: milestones tell the story, progress tracks granular work. Both must exist. Never abbreviate a milestone merely for the sake of brevity, do not leave out details that could be crucial to a future implementation.\n\nEach milestone must be independently verifiable and incrementally implement the overall goal of the execution plan.\n\n## Living plans and design decisions\n\n* ExecPlans are living documents. As you make key design decisions, update the plan to record both the decision and the thinking behind it. Record all decisions in the `Decision Log` section.\n* ExecPlans must contain and maintain a `Progress` section, a `Surprises & Discoveries` section, a `Decision Log`, and an `Outcomes & Retrospective` section. These are not optional.\n* When you discover optimizer behavior, performance tradeoffs, unexpected bugs, or inverse/unapply semantics that shaped your approach, capture those observations in the `Surprises & Discoveries` section with short evidence snippets (test output is ideal).\n* If you change course mid-implementation, document why in the `Decision Log` and reflect the implications in `Progress`. Plans are guides for the next contributor as much as checklists for you.\n* At completion of a major task or the full plan, write an `Outcomes & Retrospective` entry summarizing what was achieved, what remains, and lessons learned.\n\n# Prototyping milestones and parallel implementations\n\nIt is acceptable—-and often encouraged—-to include explicit prototyping milestones when they de-risk a larger change. Examples: adding a low-level operator to a dependency to validate feasibility, or exploring two composition orders while measuring optimizer effects. Keep prototypes additive and testable. Clearly label the scope as “prototyping”; describe how to run and observe results; and state the criteria for promoting or discarding the prototype.\n\nPrefer additive code changes followed by subtractions that keep tests passing. Parallel implementations (e.g., keeping an adapter alongside an older path during migration) are fine when they reduce risk or enable tests to continue passing during a large migration. Describe how to validate both paths and how to retire one safely with tests. When working with multiple new libraries or feature areas, consider creating spikes that evaluate the feasibility of these features _independently_ of one another, proving that the external library performs as expected and implements the features we need in isolation.\n\n## Skeleton of a Good ExecPlan\n\n    # <Short, action-oriented description>\n\n    This ExecPlan is a living document. The sections `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` must be kept up to date as work proceeds.\n\n    If PLANS.md file is checked into the repo, reference the path to that file here from the repository root and note that this document must be maintained in accordance with PLANS.md.\n\n    ## Purpose / Big Picture\n\n    Explain in a few sentences what someone gains after this change and how they can see it working. State the user-visible behavior you will enable.\n\n    ## Progress\n\n    Use a list with checkboxes to summarize granular steps. Every stopping point must be documented here, even if it requires splitting a partially completed task into two (“done” vs. “remaining”). This section must always reflect the actual current state of the work.\n\n    - [x] (2025-10-01 13:00Z) Example completed step.\n    - [ ] Example incomplete step.\n    - [ ] Example partially completed step (completed: X; remaining: Y).\n\n    Use timestamps to measure rates of progress.\n\n    ## Surprises & Discoveries\n\n    Document unexpected behaviors, bugs, optimizations, or insights discovered during implementation. Provide concise evidence.\n\n    - Observation: …\n      Evidence: …\n\n    ## Decision Log\n\n    Record every decision made while working on the plan in the format:\n\n    - Decision: …\n      Rationale: …\n      Date/Author: …\n\n    ## Outcomes & Retrospective\n\n    Summarize outcomes, gaps, and lessons learned at major milestones or at completion. Compare the result against the original purpose.\n\n    ## Context and Orientation\n\n    Describe the current state relevant to this task as if the reader knows nothing. Name the key files and modules by full path. Define any non-obvious term you will use. Do not refer to prior plans.\n\n    ## Plan of Work\n\n    Describe, in prose, the sequence of edits and additions. For each edit, name the file and location (function, module) and what to insert or change. Keep it concrete and minimal.\n\n    ## Concrete Steps\n\n    State the exact commands to run and where to run them (working directory). When a command generates output, show a short expected transcript so the reader can compare. This section must be updated as work proceeds.\n\n    ## Validation and Acceptance\n\n    Describe how to start or exercise the system and what to observe. Phrase acceptance as behavior, with specific inputs and outputs. If tests are involved, say \"run <project’s test command> and expect <N> passed; the new test <name> fails before the change and passes after>\".\n\n    ## Idempotence and Recovery\n\n    If steps can be repeated safely, say so. If a step is risky, provide a safe retry or rollback path. Keep the environment clean after completion.\n\n    ## Artifacts and Notes\n\n    Include the most important transcripts, diffs, or snippets as indented examples. Keep them concise and focused on what proves success.\n\n    ## Interfaces and Dependencies\n\n    Be prescriptive. Name the libraries, modules, and services to use and why. Specify the types, traits/interfaces, and function signatures that must exist at the end of the milestone. Prefer stable names and paths such as `crate::module::function` or `package.submodule.Interface`. E.g.:\n\n    In crates/foo/planner.rs, define:\n\n        pub trait Planner {\n            fn plan(&self, observed: &Observed) -> Vec<Action>;\n        }\n\nIf you follow the guidance above, a single, stateless agent -- or a human novice -- can read your ExecPlan from top to bottom and produce a working, observable result. That is the bar: SELF-CONTAINED, SELF-SUFFICIENT, NOVICE-GUIDING, OUTCOME-FOCUSED.\n\nWhen you revise a plan, you must ensure your changes are comprehensively reflected across all sections, including the living document sections, and you must write a note at the bottom of the plan describing the change and the reason why. ExecPlans must describe not just the what but the why for almost everything."},"uuid":"eeaa8e22-bfb0-466a-8304-92b3947ccd0b","timestamp":"2026-02-12T14:06:33.329Z","thinkingMetadata":{"maxThinkingTokens":31999},"permissionMode":"default"}

Includes custom slash commands.\n\nSkills extend what Claude can do. Create a `SKILL.md` file with instructions, and Claude adds it to its toolkit. Claude uses skills when relevant, or you can invoke one directly with `/skill-name`.\n\n<Note>\n  For built-in commands like `/help` and `/compact`, see [interactive mode](/en/interactive-mode#built-in-commands).\n\n  **Custom slash commands have been merged into skills.** A file at `.claude/commands/review.md` and a skill at `.claude/skills/review/SKILL.md` both create `/review` and work the same way. Your existing `.claude/commands/` files keep working. Skills add optional features: a directory for supporting files, frontmatter to [control whether you or Claude invokes them](#control-who-invokes-a-skill), and the ability for Claude to load them automatically when relevant.\n</Note>\n\nClaude Code skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard, which works across multiple AI tools. Claude Code extends the standard with additional features like [invocation control](#control-who-invokes-a-skill), [subagent execution](#run-skills-in-a-subagent), and [dynamic context injection](#inject-dynamic-context).\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Create your first skill\n\nThis example creates a skill that teaches Claude to explain code using visual diagrams and analogies. Since it uses default frontmatter, Claude can load it automatically when you ask how something works, or you can invoke it directly with `/explain-code`.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Create the skill directory\">\n    Create a directory for the skill in your personal skills folder. Personal skills are available across all your projects.\n\n    ```bash  theme={null}\n    mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/explain-code\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Write SKILL.md\">\n    Every skill needs a `SKILL.md` file with two parts: YAML frontmatter (between `---` markers) that tells Claude when to use the skill, and markdown content with instructions Claude follows when the skill is invoked. The `name` field becomes the `/slash-command`, and the `description` helps Claude decide when to load it automatically.\n\n    Create `~/.claude/skills/explain-code/SKILL.md`:\n\n    ```yaml  theme={null}\n    ---\n    name: explain-code\n    description: Explains code with visual diagrams and analogies. Use when explaining how code works, teaching about a codebase, or when the user asks \"how does this work?\"\n    ---\n\n    When explaining code, always include:\n\n    1. **Start with an analogy**: Compare the code to something from everyday life\n    2. **Draw a diagram**: Use ASCII art to show the flow, structure, or relationships\n    3. **Walk through the code**: Explain step-by-step what happens\n    4. **Highlight a gotcha**: What's a common mistake or misconception?\n\n    Keep explanations conversational. For complex concepts, use multiple analogies.\n    ```\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Test the skill\">\n    You can test it two ways:\n\n    **Let Claude invoke it automatically** by asking something that matches the description:\n\n    ```\n    How does this code work?\n    ```\n\n    **Or invoke it directly** with the skill name:\n\n    ```\n    /explain-code src/auth/login.ts\n    ```\n\n    Either way, Claude should include an analogy and ASCII diagram in its explanation.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n### Where skills live\n\nWhere you store a skill determines who can use it:\n\n| Location   | Path                                                     | Applies to                     |\n| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |\n| Enterprise | See [managed settings](/en/permissions#managed-settings) | All users in your organization |\n| Personal   | `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`                 | All your projects              |\n| Project    | `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`                   | This project only              |\n| Plugin     | `<plugin>/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`                  | Where plugin is enabled        |\n\nWhen skills share the same name across levels, higher-priority locations win: enterprise > personal > project. Plugin skills use a `plugin-name:skill-name` namespace, so they cannot conflict with other levels. If you have files in `.claude/commands/`, those work the same way, but if a skill and a command share the same name, the skill takes precedence.\n\n#### Automatic discovery from nested directories\n\nWhen you work with files in subdirectories, Claude Code automatically discovers skills from nested `.claude/skills/` directories. For example, if you're editing a file in `packages/frontend/`, Claude Code also looks for skills in `packages/frontend/.claude/skills/`. This supports monorepo setups where packages have their own skills.\n\nEach skill is a directory with `SKILL.md` as the entrypoint:\n\n```\nmy-skill/\n├── SKILL.md           # Main instructions (required)\n├── template.md        # Template for Claude to fill in\n├── examples/\n│   └── sample.md      # Example output showing expected format\n└── scripts/\n    └── validate.sh    # Script Claude can execute\n```\n\nThe `SKILL.md` contains the main instructions and is required. Other files are optional and let you build more powerful skills: templates for Claude to fill in, example outputs showing the expected format, scripts Claude can execute, or detailed reference documentation. Reference these files from your `SKILL.md` so Claude knows what they contain and when to load them. See [Add supporting files](#add-supporting-files) for more details.\n\n<Note>\n  Files in `.claude/commands/` still work and support the same [frontmatter](#frontmatter-reference). Skills are recommended since they support additional features like supporting files.\n</Note>\n\n#### Skills from additional directories\n\nSkills defined in `.claude/skills/` within directories added via `--add-dir` are loaded automatically and picked up by live change detection, so you can edit them during a session without restarting.\n\n<Note>\n  CLAUDE.md files from `--add-dir` directories are not loaded by default. To load them, set `CLAUDE_CODE_ADDITIONAL_DIRECTORIES_CLAUDE_MD=1`. See [Load memory from additional directories](/en/memory#load-memory-from-additional-directories).\n</Note>\n\n## Configure skills\n\nSkills are configured through YAML frontmatter at the top of `SKILL.md` and the markdown content that follows.\n\n### Types of skill content\n\nSkill files can contain any instructions, but thinking about how you want to invoke them helps guide what to include:\n\n**Reference content** adds knowledge Claude applies to your current work. Conventions, patterns, style guides, domain knowledge. This content runs inline so Claude can use it alongside your conversation context.\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: api-conventions\ndescription: API design patterns for this codebase\n---\n\nWhen writing API endpoints:\n- Use RESTful naming conventions\n- Return consistent error formats\n- Include request validation\n```\n\n**Task content** gives Claude step-by-step instructions for a specific action, like deployments, commits, or code generation. These are often actions you want to invoke directly with `/skill-name` rather than letting Claude decide when to run them. Add `disable-model-invocation: true` to prevent Claude from triggering it automatically.\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: deploy\ndescription: Deploy the application to production\ncontext: fork\ndisable-model-invocation: true\n---\n\nDeploy the application:\n1. Run the test suite\n2. Build the application\n3. Push to the deployment target\n```\n\nYour `SKILL.md` can contain anything, but thinking through how you want the skill invoked (by you, by Claude, or both) and where you want it to run (inline or in a subagent) helps guide what to include. For complex skills, you can also [add supporting files](#add-supporting-files) to keep the main skill focused.\n\n### Frontmatter reference\n\nBeyond the markdown content, you can configure skill behavior using YAML frontmatter fields between `---` markers at the top of your `SKILL.md` file:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: my-skill\ndescription: What this skill does\ndisable-model-invocation: true\nallowed-tools: Read, Grep\n---\n\nYour skill instructions here...\n```\n\nAll fields are optional. Only `description` is recommended so Claude knows when to use the skill.\n\n| Field                      | Required    | Description                                                                                                                                           |\n| :------------------------- | :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `name`                     | No          | Display name for the skill. If omitted, uses the directory name. Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only (max 64 characters).                    |\n| `description`              | Recommended | What the skill does and when to use it. Claude uses this to decide when to apply the skill. If omitted, uses the first paragraph of markdown content. |\n| `argument-hint`            | No          | Hint shown during autocomplete to indicate expected arguments. Example: `[issue-number]` or `[filename] [format]`.                                    |\n| `disable-model-invocation` | No          | Set to `true` to prevent Claude from automatically loading this skill. Use for workflows you want to trigger manually with `/name`. Default: `false`. |\n| `user-invocable`           | No          | Set to `false` to hide from the `/` menu. Use for background knowledge users shouldn't invoke directly. Default: `true`.                              |\n| `allowed-tools`            | No          | Tools Claude can use without asking permission when this skill is active.                                                                             |\n| `model`                    | No          | Model to use when this skill is active.                                                                                                               |\n| `context`                  | No          | Set to `fork` to run in a forked subagent context.                                                                                                    |\n| `agent`                    | No          | Which subagent type to use when `context: fork` is set.                                                                                               |\n| `hooks`                    | No          | Hooks scoped to this skill's lifecycle. See [Hooks in skills and agents](/en/hooks#hooks-in-skills-and-agents) for configuration format.              |\n\n#### Available string substitutions\n\nSkills support string substitution for dynamic values in the skill content:\n\n| Variable               | Description                                                                                                                                  |\n| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `$ARGUMENTS`           | All arguments passed when invoking the skill. If `$ARGUMENTS` is not present in the content, arguments are appended as `ARGUMENTS: <value>`. |\n| `$ARGUMENTS[N]`        | Access a specific argument by 0-based index, such as `$ARGUMENTS[0]` for the first argument.                                                 |\n| `$N`                   | Shorthand for `$ARGUMENTS[N]`, such as `$0` for the first argument or `$1` for the second.                                                   |\n| `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` | The current session ID. Useful for logging, creating session-specific files, or correlating skill output with sessions.                      |\n\n**Example using substitutions:**\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: session-logger\ndescription: Log activity for this session\n---\n\nLog the following to logs/${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}.log:\n\n$ARGUMENTS\n```\n\n### Add supporting files\n\nSkills can include multiple files in their directory. This keeps `SKILL.md` focused on the essentials while letting Claude access detailed reference material only when needed. Large reference docs, API specifications, or example collections don't need to load into context every time the skill runs.\n\n```\nmy-skill/\n├── SKILL.md (required - overview and navigation)\n├── reference.md (detailed API docs - loaded when needed)\n├── examples.md (usage examples - loaded when needed)\n└── scripts/\n    └── helper.py (utility script - executed, not loaded)\n```\n\nReference supporting files from `SKILL.md` so Claude knows what each file contains and when to load it:\n\n```markdown  theme={null}\n## Additional resources\n\n- For complete API details, see [reference.md](reference.md)\n- For usage examples, see [examples.md](examples.md)\n```\n\n<Tip>Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. Move detailed reference material to separate files.</Tip>\n\n### Control who invokes a skill\n\nBy default, both you and Claude can invoke any skill. You can type `/skill-name` to invoke it directly, and Claude can load it automatically when relevant to your conversation. Two frontmatter fields let you restrict this:\n\n* **`disable-model-invocation: true`**: Only you can invoke the skill. Use this for workflows with side effects or that you want to control timing, like `/commit`, `/deploy`, or `/send-slack-message`. You don't want Claude deciding to deploy because your code looks ready.\n\n* **`user-invocable: false`**: Only Claude can invoke the skill. Use this for background knowledge that isn't actionable as a command. A `legacy-system-context` skill explains how an old system works. Claude should know this when relevant, but `/legacy-system-context` isn't a meaningful action for users to take.\n\nThis example creates a deploy skill that only you can trigger. The `disable-model-invocation: true` field prevents Claude from running it automatically:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: deploy\ndescription: Deploy the application to production\ndisable-model-invocation: true\n---\n\nDeploy $ARGUMENTS to production:\n\n1. Run the test suite\n2. Build the application\n3. Push to the deployment target\n4. Verify the deployment succeeded\n```\n\nHere's how the two fields affect invocation and context loading:\n\n| Frontmatter                      | You can invoke | Claude can invoke | When loaded into context                                     |\n| :------------------------------- | :------------- | :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| (default)                        | Yes            | Yes               | Description always in context, full skill loads when invoked |\n| `disable-model-invocation: true` | Yes            | No                | Description not in context, full skill loads when you invoke |\n| `user-invocable: false`          | No             | Yes               | Description always in context, full skill loads when invoked |\n\n<Note>\n  In a regular session, skill descriptions are loaded into context so Claude knows what's available, but full skill content only loads when invoked. [Subagents with preloaded skills](/en/sub-agents#preload-skills-into-subagents) work differently: the full skill content is injected at startup.\n</Note>\n\n### Restrict tool access\n\nUse the `allowed-tools` field to limit which tools Claude can use when a skill is active. This skill creates a read-only mode where Claude can explore files but not modify them:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: safe-reader\ndescription: Read files without making changes\nallowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob\n---\n```\n\n### Pass arguments to skills\n\nBoth you and Claude can pass arguments when invoking a skill. Arguments are available via the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder.\n\nThis skill fixes a GitHub issue by number. The `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder gets replaced with whatever follows the skill name:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: fix-issue\ndescription: Fix a GitHub issue\ndisable-model-invocation: true\n---\n\nFix GitHub issue $ARGUMENTS following our coding standards.\n\n1. Read the issue description\n2. Understand the requirements\n3. Implement the fix\n4. Write tests\n5. Create a commit\n```\n\nWhen you run `/fix-issue 123`, Claude receives \"Fix GitHub issue 123 following our coding standards...\"\n\nIf you invoke a skill with arguments but the skill doesn't include `$ARGUMENTS`, Claude Code appends `ARGUMENTS: <your input>` to the end of the skill content so Claude still sees what you typed.\n\nTo access individual arguments by position, use `$ARGUMENTS[N]` or the shorter `$N`:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: migrate-component\ndescription: Migrate a component from one framework to another\n---\n\nMigrate the $ARGUMENTS[0] component from $ARGUMENTS[1] to $ARGUMENTS[2].\nPreserve all existing behavior and tests.\n```\n\nRunning `/migrate-component SearchBar React Vue` replaces `$ARGUMENTS[0]` with `SearchBar`, `$ARGUMENTS[1]` with `React`, and `$ARGUMENTS[2]` with `Vue`. The same skill using the `$N` shorthand:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: migrate-component\ndescription: Migrate a component from one framework to another\n---\n\nMigrate the $0 component from $1 to $2.\nPreserve all existing behavior and tests.\n```\n\n## Advanced patterns\n\n### Inject dynamic context\n\nThe `!`command\\`\\` syntax runs shell commands before the skill content is sent to Claude. The command output replaces the placeholder, so Claude receives actual data, not the command itself.\n\nThis skill summarizes a pull request by fetching live PR data with the GitHub CLI. The `!`gh pr diff\\`\\` and other commands run first, and their output gets inserted into the prompt:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: pr-summary\ndescription: Summarize changes in a pull request\ncontext: fork\nagent: Explore\nallowed-tools: Bash(gh *)\n---\n\n## Pull request context\n- PR diff: !`gh pr diff`\n- PR comments: !`gh pr view --comments`\n- Changed files: !`gh pr diff --name-only`\n\n## Your task\nSummarize this pull request...\n```\n\nWhen this skill runs:\n\n1. Each `!`command\\`\\` executes immediately (before Claude sees anything)\n2. The output replaces the placeholder in the skill content\n3. Claude receives the fully-rendered prompt with actual PR data\n\nThis is preprocessing, not something Claude executes. Claude only sees the final result.\n\n<Tip>\n  To enable [extended thinking](/en/common-workflows#use-extended-thinking-thinking-mode) in a skill, include the word \"ultrathink\" anywhere in your skill content.\n</Tip>\n\n### Run skills in a subagent\n\nAdd `context: fork` to your frontmatter when you want a skill to run in isolation. The skill content becomes the prompt that drives the subagent. It won't have access to your conversation history.\n\n<Warning>\n  `context: fork` only makes sense for skills with explicit instructions. If your skill contains guidelines like \"use these API conventions\" without a task, the subagent receives the guidelines but no actionable prompt, and returns without meaningful output.\n</Warning>\n\nSkills and [subagents](/en/sub-agents) work together in two directions:\n\n| Approach                     | System prompt                             | Task                        | Also loads                   |\n| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :--------------------------- |\n| Skill with `context: fork`   | From agent type (`Explore`, `Plan`, etc.) | SKILL.md content            | CLAUDE.md                    |\n| Subagent with `skills` field | Subagent's markdown body                  | Claude's delegation message | Preloaded skills + CLAUDE.md |\n\nWith `context: fork`, you write the task in your skill and pick an agent type to execute it. For the inverse (defining a custom subagent that uses skills as reference material), see [Subagents](/en/sub-agents#preload-skills-into-subagents).\n\n#### Example: Research skill using Explore agent\n\nThis skill runs research in a forked Explore agent. The skill content becomes the task, and the agent provides read-only tools optimized for codebase exploration:\n\n```yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: deep-research\ndescription: Research a topic thoroughly\ncontext: fork\nagent: Explore\n---\n\nResearch $ARGUMENTS thoroughly:\n\n1. Find relevant files using Glob and Grep\n2. Read and analyze the code\n3. Summarize findings with specific file references\n```\n\nWhen this skill runs:\n\n1. A new isolated context is created\n2. The subagent receives the skill content as its prompt (\"Research \\$ARGUMENTS thoroughly...\")\n3. The `agent` field determines the execution environment (model, tools, and permissions)\n4. Results are summarized and returned to your main conversation\n\nThe `agent` field specifies which subagent configuration to use. Options include built-in agents (`Explore`, `Plan`, `general-purpose`) or any custom subagent from `.claude/agents/`. If omitted, uses `general-purpose`.\n\n### Restrict Claude's skill access\n\nBy default, Claude can invoke any skill that doesn't have `disable-model-invocation: true` set. Skills that define `allowed-tools` grant Claude access to those tools without per-use approval when the skill is active. Your [permission settings](/en/permissions) still govern baseline approval behavior for all other tools. Built-in commands like `/compact` and `/init` are not available through the Skill tool.\n\nThree ways to control which skills Claude can invoke:\n\n**Disable all skills** by denying the Skill tool in `/permissions`:\n\n```\n# Add to deny rules:\nSkill\n```\n\n**Allow or deny specific skills** using [permission rules](/en/permissions):\n\n```\n# Allow only specific skills\nSkill(commit)\nSkill(review-pr *)\n\n# Deny specific skills\nSkill(deploy *)\n```\n\nPermission syntax: `Skill(name)` for exact match, `Skill(name *)` for prefix match with any arguments.\n\n**Hide individual skills** by adding `disable-model-invocation: true` to their frontmatter. This removes the skill from Claude's context entirely.\n\n<Note>\n  The `user-invocable` field only controls menu visibility, not Skill tool access. Use `disable-model-invocation: true` to block programmatic invocation.\n</Note>\n\n## Share skills\n\nSkills can be distributed at different scopes depending on your audience:\n\n* **Project skills**: Commit `.claude/skills/` to version control\n* **Plugins**: Create a `skills/` directory in your [plugin](/en/plugins)\n* **Managed**: Deploy organization-wide through [managed settings](/en/permissions#managed-settings)\n\n### Generate visual output\n\nSkills can bundle and run scripts in any language, giving Claude capabilities beyond what's possible in a single prompt. One powerful pattern is generating visual output: interactive HTML files that open in your browser for exploring data, debugging, or creating reports.\n\nThis example creates a codebase explorer: an interactive tree view where you can expand and collapse directories, see file sizes at a glance, and identify file types by color.\n\nCreate the Skill directory:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nmkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/codebase-visualizer/scripts\n```\n\nCreate `~/.claude/skills/codebase-visualizer/SKILL.md`. The description tells Claude when to activate this Skill, and the instructions tell Claude to run the bundled script:\n\n````yaml  theme={null}\n---\nname: codebase-visualizer\ndescription: Generate an interactive collapsible tree visualization of your codebase. Use when exploring a new repo, understanding project structure, or identifying large files.\nallowed-tools: Bash(python *)\n---\n\n# Codebase Visualizer\n\nGenerate an interactive HTML tree view that shows your project's file structure with collapsible directories.\n\n## Usage\n\nRun the visualization script from your project root:\n\n```bash\npython ~/.claude/skills/codebase-visualizer/scripts/visualize.py .\n```\n\nThis creates `codebase-map.html` in the current directory and opens it in your default browser.\n\n## What the visualization shows\n\n- **Collapsible directories**: Click folders to expand/collapse\n- **File sizes**: Displayed next to each file\n- **Colors**: Different colors for different file types\n- **Directory totals**: Shows aggregate size of each folder\n````\n\nCreate `~/.claude/skills/codebase-visualizer/scripts/visualize.py`. This script scans a directory tree and generates a self-contained HTML file with:\n\n* A **summary sidebar** showing file count, directory count, total size, and number of file types\n* A **bar chart** breaking down the codebase by file type (top 8 by size)\n* A **collapsible tree** where you can expand and collapse directories, with color-coded file type indicators\n\nThe script requires Python but uses only built-in libraries, so there are no packages to install:\n\n```python expandable theme={null}\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\"\"\"Generate an interactive collapsible tree visualization of a codebase.\"\"\"\n\nimport json\nimport sys\nimport webbrowser\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nIGNORE = {'.git', 'node_modules', '__pycache__', '.venv', 'venv', 'dist', 'build'}\n\ndef scan(path: Path, stats: dict) -> dict:\n    result = {\"name\": path.name, \"children\": [], \"size\": 0}\n    try:\n        for item in sorted(path.iterdir()):\n            if item.name in IGNORE or item.name.startswith('.'):\n                continue\n            if item.is_file():\n                size = item.stat().st_size\n                ext = item.suffix.lower() or '(no ext)'\n                result[\"children\"].append({\"name\": item.name, \"size\": size, \"ext\": ext})\n                result[\"size\"] += size\n                stats[\"files\"] += 1\n                stats[\"extensions\"][ext] += 1\n                stats[\"ext_sizes\"][ext] += size\n            elif item.is_dir():\n                stats[\"dirs\"] += 1\n                child = scan(item, stats)\n                if child[\"children\"]:\n                    result[\"children\"].append(child)\n                    result[\"size\"] += child[\"size\"]\n    except PermissionError:\n        pass\n    return result\n\ndef generate_html(data: dict, stats: dict, output: Path) -> None:\n    ext_sizes = stats[\"ext_sizes\"]\n    total_size = sum(ext_sizes.values()) or 1\n    sorted_exts = sorted(ext_sizes.items(), key=lambda x: -x[1])[:8]\n    colors = {\n        '.js': '#f7df1e', '.ts': '#3178c6', '.py': '#3776ab', '.go': '#00add8',\n        '.rs': '#dea584', '.rb': '#cc342d', '.css': '#264de4', '.html': '#e34c26',\n        '.json': '#6b7280', '.md': '#083fa1', '.yaml': '#cb171e', '.yml': '#cb171e',\n        '.mdx': '#083fa1', '.tsx': '#3178c6', '.jsx': '#61dafb', '.sh': '#4eaa25',\n    }\n    lang_bars = \"\".join(\n        f'<div class=\"bar-row\"><span class=\"bar-label\">{ext}</span>'\n        f'<div class=\"bar\" style=\"width:{(size/total_size)*100}%;background:{colors.get(ext,\"#6b7280\")}\"></div>'\n        f'<span class=\"bar-pct\">{(size/total_size)*100:.1f}%</span></div>'\n        for ext, size in sorted_exts\n    )\n    def fmt(b):\n        if b < 1024: return f\"{b} B\"\n        if b < 1048576: return f\"{b/1024:.1f} KB\"\n        return f\"{b/1048576:.1f} MB\"\n\n    html = f'''<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html><head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\"><title>Codebase Explorer</title>\n  <style>\n    body {{ font: 14px/1.5 system-ui, sans-serif;

The bundled script does the heavy lifting while Claude handles orchestration.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Skill not triggering\n\nIf Claude doesn't use your skill when expected:\n\n1. Check the description includes keywords users would naturally say\n2. Verify the skill appears in `What skills are available?`\n3. Try rephrasing your request to match the description more closely\n4. Invoke it directly with `/skill-name` if the skill is user-invocable\n\n### Skill triggers too often\n\nIf Claude uses your skill when you don't want it:\n\n1. Make the description more specific\n2. Add `disable-model-invocation: true` if you only want manual invocation\n\n### Claude doesn't see all my skills\n\nSkill descriptions are loaded into context so Claude knows what's available. If you have many skills, they may exceed the character budget. The budget scales dynamically at 2% of the context window, with a fallback of 16,000 characters. Run `/context` to check for a warning about excluded skills.\n\nTo override the limit, set the `SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET` environment variable.\n\n## Related resources\n\n* **[Subagents](/en/sub-agents)**: delegate tasks to specialized agents\n* **[Plugins](/en/plugins)**: package and distribute skills with other extensions\n* **[Hooks](/en/hooks)**: automate workflows around tool events\n* **[Memory](/en/memory)**: manage CLAUDE.md files for persistent context\n* **[Interactive mode](/en/interactive-mode#built-in-commands)**: built-in commands and shortcuts\n* **[Permissions](/en/permissions)**: control tool and skill access\n"}]},"uuid":"616c2e19-5502-4b00-96c9-bb41fb669ba0","timestamp":"2026-02-12T14:06:48.029Z"},"normalizedMessages":[],"type":"agent_progress","prompt":"How do I create a custom skill in Claude Code?

YAML frontmatter (between `---` markers) for configuration\n2. Markdown content with the actual instructions Claude follows\n\n### Basic Skill Example: Custom Prompt Skill\n\nCreate a simple skill by making the directory and writing SKILL.md:\n\n**Step 1: Create the directory**\n\nFor a personal skill (available across all your projects):\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/my-skill\n```\n\nFor a project-specific skill:\n```bash\nmkdir -p /Users/ob1/projects/opus-hackathon/napoli-matcha/.claude/skills/my-skill\n```\n\n**Step 2: Create SKILL.md with frontmatter**\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: my-skill\ndescription: What this skill does and when to use it\n---\n\nYour custom prompt and instructions here...\n```\n\n### Complete Frontmatter Reference\n\nHere are all available configuration options for `SKILL.md`:\n\n| Field | Required | Description |\n|-------|----------|-------------|\n| `name` | No | Display name and `/slash-command`. Lowercase, hyphens, max 64 chars. If omitted, uses directory name. |\n| `description` | Recommended | What the skill does. Claude uses this to decide when to auto-load it. |\n| `disable-model-invocation` | No | Set to `true` to prevent Claude from auto-invoking. Use for manual-only commands like `/deploy`. |\n| `user-invocable` | No | Set to `false` to hide from `/` menu. Use for background knowledge only. |\n| `allowed-tools` | No | Comma-separated tools Claude can use without permission (e.g., `Read, Grep, Bash`). |\n| `argument-hint` | No | Show autocomplete hint like `[issue-number]` or `[file] [format]`. |\n| `context` | No | Set to `fork` to run in isolated subagent context. |\n| `agent` | No | Which subagent type: `Explore`, `Plan`, `general-purpose`. Used with `context: fork`. |\n| `model` | No | Specify a model for this skill. |\n| `hooks` | No | Hooks scoped to this skill's lifecycle. |\n\n### Practical Examples\n\n#### Example 1: Manual Deploy Command\n\nFor a command you only want to invoke manually:\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: deploy\ndescription: Deploy the application to production\ndisable-model-invocation: true\n---\n\nDeploy the application to production:\n\n1. Run `npm test` to verify all tests pass\n2. Build the application: `npm run build`\n3. Push to deployment: `npm run deploy`\n4. Verify the deployment succeeded by checking the logs\n```\n\nUsage: Type `/deploy` in the chat to trigger it.\n\n#### Example 2: Auto-Invokable Skill with Arguments\n\nFor skills Claude can trigger automatically:\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: fix-issue\ndescription: Fix a GitHub issue by reading the issue details and implementing a solution\n---\n\nFix GitHub issue $ARGUMENTS following our coding standards:\n\n1. Read the issue description to understand requirements\n2. Search the codebase for related code using Grep and Glob\n3. Implement the fix with proper error handling\n4. Write tests to verify the fix works\n5. Create a commit with a clear message\n```\n\nUsage: Claude auto-invokes when you say \"fix issue 123\", or you can type `/fix-issue 123`.\n\n#### Example 3: Read-Only Safe Mode\n\nRestrict Claude to only reading files:\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: safe-reader\ndescription: Analyze and explore code without making changes\nallowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob\n---\n\nWhen in safe-reader mode, analyze the codebase thoroughly:\n\n1. Find relevant files using Glob and Grep\n2. Read and understand the code structure\n3. Provide detailed analysis and recommendations\n4. Do NOT make any edits or modifications\n```\n\n#### Example 4: Using Arguments with Substitution\n\nAccess individual arguments by position:\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: migrate-component\ndescription: Migrate a component from one framework to another\n---\n\nMigrate the $0 component from $1 to $2.\n\nPreserve all existing behavior and tests:\n- Keep the same props/inputs interface\n- Maintain the same output/results\n- Ensure all tests continue to pass\n- Update imports throughout the codebase\n```\n\nUsage: `/migrate-component SearchBar React Vue`\n\nThe substitutions work as:\n- `$ARGUMENTS` - all arguments as a string\n- `$0`, `$1`, `$2` - individual arguments by position\n- `$ARGUMENTS[0]`, `$ARGUMENTS[1]` - alternative syntax\n- `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` - current session ID\n\n#### Example 5: Skill with Dynamic Context (Command Injection)\n\nRun shell commands to inject live data:\n\n```yaml\n---\nname: pr-summary\ndescription: Summarize changes in the current pull request\ncontext: fork\nagent: Explore\nallowed-tools: Bash(gh *)\n---\n\n## Pull request context\n\n- PR diff: !`gh pr diff`\n- PR comments: !`gh pr view --comments`\n- Changed files: !`gh pr diff --name-only`\n\n## Your task\n\nSummarize this pull request, highlighting:\n1. What problem does this PR solve?\n2. What files changed and why?\n3. Are there any concerns or improvements needed?\n```\n\nThe `!`command`` syntax executes before Claude sees the prompt.

Use when planning complex features or system changes that require detailed, self-contained implementation guidance.\n---\n\n# Codex Execution Plans (ExecPlans):\n\nThis document describes the requirements for an execution plan (\"ExecPlan\"), a design document that a coding agent can follow to deliver a working feature or system change. Treat the reader as a complete beginner to this repository: they have only the current working tree and the single ExecPlan file you provide. There is no memory of prior plans and no external context.\n\n## How to use ExecPlans and PLANS.md\n\nWhen authoring an executable specification (ExecPlan), follow PLANS.md _to the letter_. If it is not in your context, refresh your memory by reading the entire PLANS.md file. Be thorough in reading (and re-reading) source material to produce an accurate specification. When creating a spec, start from the skeleton and flesh it out as you do your research.\n\nWhen implementing an executable specification (ExecPlan), do not prompt the user for \"next steps\"; simply proceed to the next milestone. Keep all sections up to date, add or split entries in the list at every stopping point to affirmatively state the progress made and next steps. Resolve ambiguities autonomously, and commit frequently.\n\nWhen discussing an executable specification (ExecPlan), record decisions in a log in the spec for posterity; it should be unambiguously clear why any change to the specification was made. ExecPlans are living documents, and it should always be possible to restart from _only_ the ExecPlan and no other work.\n\nWhen researching a design with challenging requirements or significant unknowns, use milestones to implement proof of concepts, \"toy implementations\", etc., that allow validating whether the user's proposal is feasible. Read the source code of libraries by finding or acquiring them, research deeply, and include prototypes to guide a fuller implementation.\n\n## Requirements\n\nNON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Every ExecPlan must be fully self-contained. Self-contained means that in its current form it contains all knowledge and instructions needed for a novice to succeed.\n* Every ExecPlan is a living document. Contributors are required to revise it as progress is made, as discoveries occur, and as design decisions are finalized. Each revision must remain fully self-contained.\n* Every ExecPlan must enable a complete novice to implement the feature end-to-end without prior knowledge of this repo.\n* Every ExecPlan must produce a demonstrably working behavior, not merely code changes to \"meet a definition\".\n* Every ExecPlan must define every term of art in plain language or do not use it.\n\nPurpose and intent come first. Begin by explaining, in a few sentences, why the work matters from a user's perspective: what someone can do after this change that they could not do before, and how to see it working. Then guide the reader through the exact steps to achieve that outcome, including what to edit, what to run, and what they should observe.\n\nThe agent executing your plan can list files, read files, search, run the project, and run tests. It does not know any prior context and cannot infer what you meant from earlier milestones. Repeat any assumption you rely on. Do not point to external blogs or docs; if knowledge is required, embed it in the plan itself in your own words. If an ExecPlan builds upon a prior ExecPlan and that file is checked in, incorporate it by reference. If it is not, you must include all relevant context from that plan.\n\n## Formatting\n\nFormat and envelope are simple and strict. Each ExecPlan must be one single fenced code block labeled as `md` that begins and ends with triple backticks. Do not nest additional triple-backtick code fences inside; when you need to show commands, transcripts, diffs, or code, present them as indented blocks within that single fence. Use indentation for clarity rather than code fences inside an ExecPlan to avoid prematurely closing the ExecPlan's code fence. Use two newlines after every heading, use # and ## and so on, and correct syntax for ordered and unordered lists.\n\nWhen writing an ExecPlan to a Markdown (.md) file where the content of the file *is only* the single ExecPlan, you should omit the triple backticks.\n\nWrite in plain prose. Prefer sentences over lists. Avoid checklists, tables, and long enumerations unless brevity would obscure meaning. Checklists are permitted only in the `Progress` section, where they are mandatory. Narrative sections must remain prose-first.\n\n## Guidelines\n\nSelf-containment and plain language are paramount. If you introduce a phrase that is not ordinary English (\"daemon\", \"middleware\", \"RPC gateway\", \"filter graph\"), define it immediately and remind the reader how it manifests in this repository (for example, by naming the files or commands where it appears). Do not say \"as defined previously\" or \"according to the architecture doc.\" Include the needed explanation here, even if you repeat yourself.\n\nAvoid common failure modes. Do not rely on undefined jargon. Do not describe \"the letter of a feature\" so narrowly that the resulting code compiles but does nothing meaningful. Do not outsource key decisions to the reader. When ambiguity exists, resolve it in the plan itself and explain why you chose that path. Err on the side of over-explaining user-visible effects and under-specifying incidental implementation details.\n\nAnchor the plan with observable outcomes. State what the user can do after implementation, the commands to run, and the outputs they should see. Acceptance should be phrased as behavior a human can verify (\"after starting the server, navigating to [http://localhost:8080/health](http://localhost:8080/health) returns HTTP 200 with body OK\") rather than internal attributes (\"added a HealthCheck struct\"). If a change is internal, explain how its impact can still be demonstrated (for example, by running tests that fail before and pass after, and by showing a scenario that uses the new behavior).\n\nSpecify repository context explicitly. Name files with full repository-relative paths, name functions and modules precisely, and describe where new files should be created. If touching multiple areas, include a short orientation paragraph that explains how those parts fit together so a novice can navigate confidently. When running commands, show the working directory and exact command line. When outcomes depend on environment, state the assumptions and provide alternatives when reasonable.\n\nBe idempotent and safe. Write the steps so they can be run multiple times without causing damage or drift. If a step can fail halfway, include how to retry or adapt. If a migration or destructive operation is necessary, spell out backups or safe fallbacks. Prefer additive, testable changes that can be validated as you go.\n\nValidation is not optional. Include instructions to run tests, to start the system if applicable, and to observe it doing something useful. Describe comprehensive testing for any new features or capabilities. Include expected outputs and error messages so a novice can tell success from failure. Where possible, show how to prove that the change is effective beyond compilation (for example, through a small end-to-end scenario, a CLI invocation, or an HTTP request/response transcript). State the exact test commands appropriate to the project's toolchain and how to interpret their results.\n\nCapture evidence. When your steps produce terminal output, short diffs, or logs, include them inside the single fenced block as indented examples. Keep them concise and focused on what proves success. If you need to include a patch, prefer file-scoped diffs or small excerpts that a reader can recreate by following your instructions rather than pasting large blobs.\n\n## Milestones\n\nMilestones are narrative, not bureaucracy. If you break the work into milestones, introduce each with a brief paragraph that describes the scope, what will exist at the end of the milestone that did not exist before, the commands to run, and the acceptance you expect to observe. Keep it readable as a story: goal, work, result, proof. Progress and milestones are distinct: milestones tell the story, progress tracks granular work. Both must exist. Never abbreviate a milestone merely for the sake of brevity, do not leave out details that could be crucial to a future implementation.\n\nEach milestone must be independently verifiable and incrementally implement the overall goal of the execution plan.\n\n## Living plans and design decisions\n\n* ExecPlans are living documents. As you make key design decisions, update the plan to record both the decision and the thinking behind it. Record all decisions in the `Decision Log` section.\n* ExecPlans must contain and maintain a `Progress` section, a `Surprises & Discoveries` section, a `Decision Log`, and an `Outcomes & Retrospective` section. These are not optional.\n* When you discover optimizer behavior, performance tradeoffs, unexpected bugs, or inverse/unapply semantics that shaped your approach, capture those observations in the `Surprises & Discoveries` section with short evidence snippets (test output is ideal).\n* If you change course mid-implementation, document why in the `Decision Log` and reflect the implications in `Progress`. Plans are guides for the next contributor as much as checklists for you.\n* At completion of a major task or the full plan, write an `Outcomes & Retrospective` entry summarizing what was achieved, what remains, and lessons learned.\n\n# Prototyping milestones and parallel implementations\n\nIt is acceptable—-and often encouraged—-to include explicit prototyping milestones when they de-risk a larger change. Examples: adding a low-level operator to a dependency to validate feasibility, or exploring two composition orders while measuring optimizer effects. Keep prototypes additive and testable. Clearly label the scope as \"prototyping\"; describe how to run and observe results; and state the criteria for promoting or discarding the prototype.\n\nPrefer additive code changes followed by subtractions that keep tests passing. Parallel implementations (e.g., keeping an adapter alongside an older path during migration) are fine when they reduce risk or enable tests to continue passing during a large migration. Describe how to validate both paths and how to retire one safely with tests. When working with multiple new libraries or feature areas, consider creating spikes that evaluate the feasibility of these features _independently_ of one another, proving that the external library performs as expected and implements the features we need in isolation.\n\n## Skeleton of a Good ExecPlan\n\n    # <Short, action-oriented description>\n\n    This ExecPlan is a living document. The sections `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` must be kept up to date as work proceeds.\n\n    If PLANS.md file is checked into the repo, reference the path to that file here from the repository root and note that this document must be maintained in accordance with PLANS.md.\n\n    ## Purpose / Big Picture\n\n    Explain in a few sentences what someone gains after this change and how they can see it working. State the user-visible behavior you will enable.\n\n    ## Progress\n\n    Use a list with checkboxes to summarize granular steps. Every stopping point must be documented here, even if it requires splitting a partially completed task into two (\"done\" vs. \"remaining\"). This section must always reflect the actual current state of the work.\n\n    - [x] (2025-10-01 13:00Z) Example completed step.\n    - [ ] Example incomplete step.\n    - [ ] Example partially completed step (completed: X; remaining: Y).\n\n    Use timestamps to measure rates of progress.\n\n    ## Surprises & Discoveries\n\n    Document unexpected behaviors, bugs, optimizations, or insights discovered during implementation. Provide concise evidence.\n\n    - Observation: …\n      Evidence: …\n\n    ## Decision Log\n\n    Record every decision made while working on the plan in the format:\n\n    - Decision: …\n      Rationale: …\n      Date/Author: …\n\n    ## Outcomes & Retrospective\n\n    Summarize outcomes, gaps, and lessons learned at major milestones or at completion. Compare the result against the original purpose.\n\n    ## Context and Orientation\n\n    Describe the current state relevant to this task as if the reader knows nothing. Name the key files and modules by full path. Define any non-obvious term you will use. Do not refer to prior plans.\n\n    ## Plan of Work\n\n    Describe, in prose, the sequence of edits and additions. For each edit, name the file and location (function, module) and what to insert or change. Keep it concrete and minimal.\n\n    ## Concrete Steps\n\n    State the exact commands to run and where to run them (working directory). When a command generates output, show a short expected transcript so the reader can compare. This section must be updated as work proceeds.\n\n    ## Validation and Acceptance\n\n    Describe how to start or exercise the system and what to observe. Phrase acceptance as behavior, with specific inputs and outputs. If tests are involved, say \"run <project's test command> and expect <N> passed; the new test <name> fails before the change and passes after>\".\n\n    ## Idempotence and Recovery\n\n    If steps can be repeated safely, say so. If a step is risky, provide a safe retry or rollback path. Keep the environment clean after completion.\n\n    ## Artifacts and Notes\n\n    Include the most important transcripts, diffs, or snippets as indented examples. Keep them concise and focused on what proves success.\n\n    ## Interfaces and Dependencies\n\n    Be prescriptive. Name the libraries, modules, and services to use and why. Specify the types, traits/interfaces, and function signatures that must exist at the end of the milestone. Prefer stable names and paths such as `crate::module::function` or `package.submodule.Interface`. E.g.:\n\n    In crates/foo/planner.rs, define:\n\n        pub trait Planner {\n            fn plan(&self, observed: &Observed) -> Vec<Action>;\n        }\n\nIf you follow the guidance above, a single, stateless agent -- or a human novice -- can read your ExecPlan from top to bottom and produce a working, observable result. That is the bar: SELF-CONTAINED, SELF-SUFFICIENT, NOVICE-GUIDING, OUTCOME-FOCUSED.\n\nWhen you revise a plan, you must ensure your changes are comprehensively reflected across all sections, including the living document sections, and you must write a note at the bottom of the plan describing the change and the reason why. ExecPlans must describe not just the what but the why for almost everything.\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":8,"cache_creation_input_tokens":431,"cache_read_input_tokens":29150,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":431,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY4Jj4w8Quak1coqpkH1f","type":"assistant","uuid":"8e3a8b48-75f3-4218-9692-284346a13ea8","timestamp":"2026-02-12T14:10:13.989Z"}

When working with multiple new libraries or feature areas, consider creating spikes that evaluate the feasibility of these features _independently_ of one another, proving that the external library performs as expected and implements the features we need in isolation.\n\n## Skeleton of a Good ExecPlan\n\n    # <Short, action-oriented description>\n\n    This ExecPlan is a living document. The sections `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` must be kept up to date as work proceeds.\n\n    If PLANS.md file is checked into the repo, reference the path to that file here from the repository root and note that this document must be maintained in accordance with PLANS.md.\n\n    ## Purpose / Big Picture\n\n    Explain in a few sentences what someone gains after this change and how they can see it working. State the user-visible behavior you will enable.\n\n    ## Progress\n\n    Use a list with checkboxes to summarize granular steps. Every stopping point must be documented here, even if it requires splitting a partially completed task into two (\"done\" vs. \"remaining\"). This section must always reflect the actual current state of the work.\n\n    - [x] (2025-10-01 13:00Z) Example completed step.\n    - [ ] Example incomplete step.\n    - [ ] Example partially completed step (completed: X; remaining: Y).\n\n    Use timestamps to measure rates of progress.\n\n    ## Surprises & Discoveries\n\n    Document unexpected behaviors, bugs, optimizations, or insights discovered during implementation. Provide concise evidence.\n\n    - Observation: …\n      Evidence: …\n\n    ## Decision Log\n\n    Record every decision made while working on the plan in the format:\n\n    - Decision: …\n      Rationale: …\n      Date/Author: …\n\n    ## Outcomes & Retrospective\n\n    Summarize outcomes, gaps, and lessons learned at major milestones or at completion. Compare the result against the original purpose.\n\n    ## Context and Orientation\n\n    Describe the current state relevant to this task as if the reader knows nothing. Name the key files and modules by full path. Define any non-obvious term you will use. Do not refer to prior plans.\n\n    ## Plan of Work\n\n    Describe, in prose, the sequence of edits and additions. For each edit, name the file and location (function, module) and what to insert or change. Keep it concrete and minimal.\n\n    ## Concrete Steps\n\n    State the exact commands to run and where to run them (working directory). When a command generates output, show a short expected transcript so the reader can compare. This section must be updated as work proceeds.\n\n    ## Validation and Acceptance\n\n    Describe how to start or exercise the system and what to observe. Phrase acceptance as behavior, with specific inputs and outputs. If tests are involved, say \"run <project's test command> and expect <N> passed; the new test <name> fails before the change and passes after>\".\n\n    ## Idempotence and Recovery\n\n    If steps can be repeated safely, say so. If a step is risky, provide a safe retry or rollback path. Keep the environment clean after completion.\n\n    ## Artifacts and Notes\n\n    Include the most important transcripts, diffs, or snippets as indented examples. Keep them concise and focused on what proves success.\n\n    ## Interfaces and Dependencies\n\n    Be prescriptive. Name the libraries, modules, and services to use and why. Specify the types, traits/interfaces, and function signatures that must exist at the end of the milestone. Prefer stable names and paths such as `crate::module::function` or `package.submodule.Interface`. E.g.:\n\n    In crates/foo/planner.rs, define:\n\n        pub trait Planner {\n            fn plan(&self, observed: &Observed) -> Vec<Action>;\n        }\n\nIf you follow the guidance above, a single, stateless agent -- or a human novice -- can read your ExecPlan from top to bottom and produce a working, observable result. That is the bar: SELF-CONTAINED, SELF-SUFFICIENT, NOVICE-GUIDING, OUTCOME-FOCUSED.\n\nWhen you revise a plan, you must ensure your changes are comprehensively reflected across all sections, including the living document sections, and you must write a note at the bottom of the plan describing the change and the reason why. ExecPlans must describe not just the what but the why for almost everything.\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"8e3a8b48-75f3-4218-9692-284346a13ea8"}
