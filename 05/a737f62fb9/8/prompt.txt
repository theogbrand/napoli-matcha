Update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to instruct Claude Code that it can refer to the implementation of Horizon CLI agent repository at path (/Users/ob1/projects/startup/horizon-cli-agent) for references on working implementations of features ported over from Horizon Agent. BUT, take note that Horizon uses Linear Application (project management tool like Jira) via MCP as the state machine for tickets. We want to instead store tickets locally in the @request_queue/ dir like we currently have to simplify things (for now)

Also, currently I have ported over the prompts in @prompts/ but they are tailored to the workflow in Horizon and need to be edited, and some new prompts need to be added (like for the test writer agent).

Edit @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md so it is clear to the Claude Code agent of how the @prompts/ directory should be referenced when working on this new plan, and also to refer to the Horizon CLI agent repository for working implementations of the Linear Reader -> Worker -> Linear Writer agent workflow (which already works well).
