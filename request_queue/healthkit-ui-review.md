  Specification defines a "Warm Precision" visual direction for Ralph —
  coral-orange accent color,

  warm neutral foundation, Geist Sans/Mono retained with refined type scale
  (mono for data values,

  smaller headings). Key UX decisions: animated fitness score ring on load,
  category cards with

  hover lift + expand/collapse animation, sparklines enlarged from 20x10 to
  80x32px, skeleton

  loading states replacing plain text, dark mode toggle with system preference
  detection, and

  consistent 200ms ease-out transitions throughout. Simplifications identified:
  remove redundant

  sync footer, shorten section headings, compact tab labels, unify trend display
  to icon-only.

  Three open questions flagged for human input: accent color confirmation, dark
  mode default

  behavior, and score ring re-animation on tab switch.
