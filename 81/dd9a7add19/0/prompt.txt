Check @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md that the worker agent should also have the ability to determine if it a ticket given to it Needs Research, Needs Specification, Needs Plan, Needs Implement, Needs Validate, and the same for In Progress Statuses, and also should have Intervention Statuses for when requiring human action.

that being said, does the current implementation plan allow the Spec Agent to judge if a ticket needs research/specification/plan/implement/validate, and say after the worker completes research/specification/plan/implement/validate, and updates to a non-terminal status, this same ticket can continue to be worked on by the next independent worker agent that picks up this ticket? 

currently this is how Horizon Agent works, and napoli-matcha should also have this capability.

Double check that even with this new enhancement, chain group dependencies implementation will still be robust.
